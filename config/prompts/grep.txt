- Fast content search tool that works with any codebase size
- Searches file contents using regular expressions
- Supports full regex syntax (eg. "log.*Error", "function\s+\w+", etc.)
- Filter files by pattern with the include parameter (eg. "*.cs", "*.{ts,tsx}")
- Returns file paths and line numbers with at least one match sorted by modification time
- Use this tool when you need to find files containing specific patterns
- For semantic code search (finding code by meaning rather than exact text), prefer the search_project tool instead.
- Grep is best for exact symbol/string searches, while search_project is better for understanding code behavior.
