- Fast file pattern matching tool that works with any codebase size
- Supports glob patterns like "**/*.cs" or "src/**/*.ts"
- Returns matching file paths sorted by modification time
- Use this tool when you need to find files by name patterns
- You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. It is always better to speculatively perform multiple searches as a batch that are potentially useful.
- For semantic code search (finding code by meaning), prefer the search_project tool instead.
