Semantic search across the project codebase. Returns relevant code snippets based on natural language queries.

This is the PREFERRED tool for code exploration and understanding:
- Use when you need to find code by meaning, not exact text
- Use for "how / where / what" questions about the codebase
- Use to understand code behavior and find implementations

When NOT to use:
- For exact text matches (use grep instead)
- For finding files by name pattern (use glob instead)
- When you already know the file path (use read instead)

Examples of good queries:
- "Where is user authentication handled?"
- "How does the payment processing work?"
- "What happens when a user submits the form?"

Examples of bad queries:
- "AuthService" (too vague, use grep for exact symbol lookup)
- Single words without context
- Multiple unrelated questions in one query
